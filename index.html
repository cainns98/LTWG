                    <h4>Hi, I'm Daniel Schroeder.</h4>
                  	<p>Have you ever tried to lose weight? Did you get the result you wanted?</p>
                    <p>If you answered yes to the first question and no to the second one, I understand. I've been there too.</p><p>That's why I founded Lose The Weight GUARANTEED. I started gaining weight in my 20s. It happened gradually, then one day I woke up and I was 70 pounds overweight.</p>
                	<p>I tried all kinds of things, including lots and lots of exercise (sound familiar?). For several years I was running 5-8 miles a day and It didn't seem to make any difference.</p>
                	<p>I clearly remember thinking, 'I guess  I'm an adult now and my metabolism has changed.' I just figured there was nothing I could do about it.</p>
                	<p>Then one day I heard about a program that sounded too good to be true. I tried it and was able to lose the weight I'd been trying to lose for so long. That was over 4 years ago and I've kept it off!</p>
                	<p>After that I started working with the company that helped me. I was hooked. Experiencing what it was like to be free from all that extra weight was huge, but helping others get the same result made it exciting to go to work each day!</p>
                	<p>I realized that the opportunity to help you get the same result was more than a job, it's a calling.</p>
                
                	<h4>Hey! I'm Gene Walker!</h4>
                	<p>I've worked with people just like you for over a year helping them lose unwanted weight. I know what it's like to struggle with it because I've tried and failed before. It's one of the great joys of my life to help others with our program because I'm a successful patient too!</p>
                	<p>As COO I focus a lot on how to make sure we don't do anything that takes us away from our mission of serving you. We only want to do things that add value to you and your result.</p>
                
                	<h4>Hi, I'm Leila Julian.</h4>
                	<p>At Lose the Weight GUARANTEED my first job is to be a Coach. A coach is someone who is invested in your success. Much more than a friend, we're someone who has helped others and have a plan to help you get from where you are to where you want to be. That's what I do.  I've already worked for over a year coaching successful patients just like you. It make me so happy to know that I get to make a real difference in your life. Seeing the difference is amazing as pounds come off. Hearing you talk about being active, having the energy to play with your kids and grandkids, makes my day! The best thing is watching your confidence grow as you reach your goals and know that you did it! Thank you for letting me do what I do!</p>
                
                  	<h4>Hi, I'm Stewart Whaley.</h4> 
                	<p>As CTO, I get to do all kinds of really cool stuff. I like gadgets and computers, but I really like what they can do for you. I'm so excited about helping you reach your goals. Losing weight is challenging no matter how you do it. A lot of times  technology gets in the way. That's why I work so hard to make sure our technology makes the process easier for you.</p>
